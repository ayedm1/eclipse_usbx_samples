## Report Descriptor

A HID (Human Interface Device) mouse report descriptor defines how data is sent from the device (mouse) to the host (computer). Below is a standard USB HID mouse report descriptor for a 3-button mouse with X and Y movement and wheel.

### Report Format Relative

This descriptor defines a 4-byte report format:

|Byte |	Bits  |	Usage |
| --- | ---   | ----- |
| 0	  | 0-2   | Buttons (Bit 0 = Left, Bit 1 = Right, Bit 2 = Middle) |
| 0	  | 3-7   | Padding (unused) |
| 1	  | 0-7   | X-axis movement (-127 to +127, relative) |
| 2	  | 0-7   | Y-axis movement (-127 to +127, relative) |

### Report Format Absolute
This descriptor defines a 6-byte report format:

|Byte |	Bits  |	Usage |
| --- | ---   | ----- |
| 0	  | 0-2	  | Buttons (Bit 0 = Left, Bit 1 = Right, Bit 2 = Middle) |
| 0	  | 3-7	  | Padding (unused) |
| 1-2 |	0-15  | X-axis Position (0 - 32767, absolute) |
| 3-4 |	0-15  | Y-axis Position (0 - 32767, absolute) |

## Run the example
